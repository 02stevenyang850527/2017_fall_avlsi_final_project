In this report, we reviewed many state- of-art very deep neural networks, including AlexNet, VGG net, Inception, ResNet and Xception. In addition to the classi cation accuracy, we conduct many aspects of tests on hardware resource consumption, namely, number of parameters, computation complexity and power consumption. We analyze the advantages and trade-o  of these deep neural networks in the view of hardware implementation and provide some insight of hardware-friendly designs.
